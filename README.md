Basketball Roster Manager
=========================
Basketball Roster Manager is a Windows desktop application that is made for use by public address announcers during basketball games, which can replace paper rosters and hand-written notes to keep up with fouls, among other helpful features.

Basketball Roster Manager is written in C#. It provides a modern UI, built on the idea that a UI is like a joke: if you have to explain it, it isn't good.

For the back-end part a local SQL database stores everything.

## Initial installation (quick & dirty documented)

The only system prerequisite is .NET Framework v4.5.  Upon initial installation the program will create a new local database in the user's roaming app data folder.

## Developing

Developing on Basketball Roster Manager is fairly easy for anyone who's familiar with C# and WinForms. If you need something explained, then you probably shouldn't be contributing to this project.

## Other ways to contribute

If you can't help with the programming, feel free to contribute by using the application and opening Issues on GitHub when you find a bug or have a suggestion.  Alternatively, you could just help pay the bills by leaving some gratuity at https://gratipay.com/joshua_carroll/.
