Basketball Roster Manager
=========================

This is a Windows desktop application that was written for use by public address announcers during basketball games.  The biggest hardship for many announcers is getting the team's roster in a timely manner.  This tool allows one to save the team's roster for the next time.  Teams are grouped by league.  

The program also allows one to change the background color of each team to match their jersey color.  

Setup
=====

Right now the database location is hard coded into the application.  That is something on which I'll be working.

Requirements/Components
=======================

1. Windows PC
2. .NET 4.5 runtime
