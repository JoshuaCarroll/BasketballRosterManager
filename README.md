Basketball Roster Manager
=========================
Basketball Roster Manager is a Windows desktop application written in C# that is made for use by public address announcers during basketball games, which can replace paper rosters and hand-written notes to keep up with fouls, among other helpful features.

## Initial installation

The only system prerequisite is .NET Framework v4.5, which is already installed on Windows computers that are regularly updated.  Upon initial installation the program will create a new local database in the user's roaming app data folder.

## Developing

I initially wrote this for my own use. I later decided to share it with other announcers. I'm not proud of the code, because of the laziness with which I wrote the initial version.  So I am constantly refactoring the original code in place of better programming practices - things I know even then, but just wanted to get it done. 

Any programmer is welcome to assist on this project.  Just make sure to submit your well documented pull request to the development branch.
