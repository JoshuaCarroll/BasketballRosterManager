Basketball Roster Manager
=========================

As an NCAA Division I public address announcer, I know that rosters are valuable.  I also know just how easy it is to get rosters mixed up.  At JV and varsity games, some coaches list players by jersey number (bless you) and some alphabetically (go stub your toe!), while sometimes all you get is a scribbled piece of paper 2 minutes before the game (seriously, who hired you?).

I created this program to help keep up with (and share) rosters, and to make finding the right name quickly as easy as possible.  Rosters are automatically sorted numerically by jersey number.  They can also be color-coded to match the teams' jerseys.  Lastly, you can easily swap the rosters from one side of the screen to the other, enabling you to keep the roster on the same side as their goal.

Basketball Roster Manager is a Windows desktop application written in C# that is made for use by public address announcers during basketball games, which can replace paper rosters and hand-written notes to keep up with fouls, among other helpful features.

## Initial installation & updates

The only system prerequisite is .NET Framework v4.5, which is already installed on Windows computers that are regularly updated.  Upon initial installation the program will create a new local database in the user's roaming app data folder.  If there is an Internet connection when the program is opened it will look for an update and, if one is available, prompt the user to install it.
